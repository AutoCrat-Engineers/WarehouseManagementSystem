# Stock Movement Workflow

> **Version:** 0.4.1 | **Last Updated:** 2026-03-06

## Overview

The Stock Movement module manages all stock changes across the warehouse system. Every stock change creates a complete audit trail with balance tracking.

## Movement Types

| Type | Direction | Trigger | Warehouse Flow |
|------|-----------|---------|----------------|
| `PRODUCTION_RECEIPT` | IN | Supervisor approval | Production → PW (FG Warehouse) |
| `DISPATCH_TO_TRANSIT` | Internal | Proforma Invoice approval | PW → In-Transit |
| `TRANSFER_TO_WAREHOUSE` | Internal | Dispatch | In-Transit → S&V / US Warehouse |
| `CUSTOMER_SALE` | OUT | Customer delivery | In-Transit → Customer |
| `RETURN_TO_PRODUCTION` | Internal | Return | PW → Production |

## Business Rules

### Stock IN
- Item must exist and be ACTIVE
- Quantity must be > 0
- Reason is REQUIRED
- Warns if stock exceeds max (but allows)
- Auto-creates inventory record if first movement

### Stock OUT
- Same validations as IN
- **Prevents negative stock** — rejected if insufficient
- Warns if stock falls below minimum
- Blanket Release ID required for shipments

### Packing Stock Transfer
- Boxes must have stickers printed
- Boxes must not already be transferred
- Updates `inv_warehouse_stock` for destination warehouse
- Creates ledger entries for source and destination
- Marks boxes as transferred

## Approval Flow

```

## Audit Trail

Every movement records:
- Timestamp

- Movement type and quantity
- Balance after transaction
- Reason and reference documents
